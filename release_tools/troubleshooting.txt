Windows:
Shift+Right-click on the directory this file is in and choose "Open command window here"
Type in the following to command prompt:

jre\bin\java -jar mountaincore.jar -Xms1200m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

Mac:
Open Terminal and navigate to the location of this file, which should be something like the following:
~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Mountaincore/Contents/Resources/
Then execute the following command:
./jre/bin/java -jar mountaincore.jar -Xms1200m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

Linux:
Open Console and navigate to the location of this file, which should be something like the following:
~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Mountaincore/
Then execute the following command:
./jre/bin/java -jar mountaincore.jar -Xms1200m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8


All platforms:
This should launch the game (or rather, fail to launch the game in the same way as the main executable) and display a stack trace/error report on the screen.
