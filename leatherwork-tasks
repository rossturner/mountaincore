Yeah it'd be nice if the weather affected it, there's an oxidisation component on items for when they get wet but not a general weather one yet. It'd be good if we made the rain rest the progress or something and that encouraged the player to put it inside without us enforcing it
With things like this I've skipped out some steps that would be done in real life like soaking in a solution but we could do that, I've done the same with the hemp
