TREE.DESCRIPTION,E.g. “Oak tree”,{{materialType.noun}} tree

TUTORIAL.1.A,,"Your settlers have three basic needs to fulfil: food, drink and somewhere to sleep. Although they will complain about it for now, they can drink from the nearby river and sleep on the ground. What they can’t do is magic up some food from nowhere (at least, not without a mage around!) so we will focus on food to begin with."
TUTORIAL.1.B,,"The first thing you should do each spring is ensure that enough crops have been planted for the harvest in autumn. Farming is a reliable and sustainable food source, but you need to make sure you have enough crops to feed your population between each annual harvest."
TUTORIAL.1.C,,"A good rule of thumb to follow is to ensure you have 10 tiles of crops being sown for each settler in your population. Currently there are 7 settlers milling around, so go ahead and click “{{GUI.ROOMS_LABEL}}” > “{{ROOMS.FARM}}”, and designate / drag out several farm plots on a grassy area."
TUTORIAL.1.D,,Use right-click to cancel and go back in menus.
TUTORIAL.2.A,,"With nothing else to do, your settlers will start preparing these {{ROOMS.FARM.PLURAL}} by tilling the earth to be ready for seeds to be sown. This doesn’t require any special tools or knowledge so everyone should get involved."
TUTORIAL.2.B,,"This prepares the plot to be sown, but you need to select which crop to grow on each farm plot before a farmer will come and plant the relevant seeds. Your settlers have brought with them a selection of different seeds. You can click “Resources” in the upper-right to get a breakdown of all the items in your settlement."
TUTORIAL.2.C,,"For the seeds to actually be available to your farmers, they need to be in a stockpile compared to being held in a dwarf’s inventory like they are currently. Click {{GUI.ZONES_LABEL}} > {{ROOMS.STOCKPILES}} > {{STOCKPILE.GROUP.SEEDS}} (you can right-click to go back up to a previous menu) and designate an area to be used for seeds to be stored."
TUTORIAL.2.D,,Your settlers have also brought a bunch of tools with them what will need moving around. From {{ROOMS.STOCKPILES}} also choose {{STOCKPILE.GROUP.TOOLS}} and designate another area to be used to store tools.
TUTORIAL.3.A,,"After some time your settlers should put items they are not using into stockpiles, like the seeds that are to be sown."
TUTORIAL.3.B,,"Left-click on each of the {{ROOMS.FARM.PLURAL}} and select a crop to be planted there. Don’t select {{VEGETABLE.BARLEY}} or {{VEGETABLE.HOPS}} for now, as these crops are used in the production of beer, not food."
TUTORIAL.4.A,,Your {{PROFESSION.FARMER.PLURAL}} will now get to work sowing the seeds you have selected to these {{ROOMS.FARM.PLURAL}}. Sowing seeds does not require any special tools but you might want to assign more settlers as {{PROFESSION.FARMER.PLURAL}}. Left-click on a settler who is wandering around aimlessly.
TUTORIAL.4.B,,"Clicking on a settler lets you see their name, professions, inventory, needs and happiness. Click on the blank square button next to their other professions to set a 3rd and final profession as a {{PROFESSION.FARMER.NOUN}}."
TUTORIAL.4.C,,"Note that some jobs require the settler to have a specific tool in their inventory, and if none are available in the settlement they won’t work on the jobs that require it. For example, you can assign more settlers as a {{PROFESSION.WOODCUTTER}}, but they can’t chop down trees without an available {{TOOL.AXE.NOUN}}."
TUTORIAL.5.A,,"Your crops will now grow and eventually be harvested by your {{PROFESSION.FARMER.PLURAL}} in the {{SEASON.AUTUMN}}. Some crops can be planted again later in the year and survive through the {{SEASON.WINTER}}, but some do not. To get the most out of your crops, it is best to produce soup from the vegetables harvested, or bread from grain."
TUTORIAL.5.B,,"Let’s get a {{ROOMS.KITCHEN}} set up to produce soup once your crops are ready. Go to the top level menu then {{GUI.ZONES_LABEL}} > {{ROOMS.KITCHEN}} and drag out a {{ROOMS.KITCHEN}} area. For now you can build this outside, but you will eventually want to move the majority of your work areas inside for protection from the elements."
TUTORIAL.5.C,,"Unlike farm plots, kitchens (and most other rooms) need furniture to function. Click “Furniture” when you have placed a kitchen zone and you’ll be presented with the furniture that can be added. To produce soup, you need to build a {{FURNITURE.WATER_BARREL}}, {{FURNITURE.KITCHEN_WORKTOP}} and {{FURNITURE.CAULDRON}} in the same kitchen zone. Also, designate a {{STOCKPILE.GROUP.FOOD}} {{ROOMS.STOCKPILE}} to store any harvested crops."
TUTORIAL.6.A,,"When your crops have been harvested, cooks will bring vegetables to the {{FURNITURE.KITCHEN_WORKTOP}} before adding them to the {{FURNITURE.CAULDRON}} with water and producing soup! Making soup and baking bread means your food supplies will go much further - a single vegetable will feed a dwarf for a single meal, but 3 vegetables cooked into soup will provide 12 meals!"
TUTORIAL.6.B,,"Eventually this kitchen will produce a cauldron full of steaming hot soup, but the cooks don’t like other dwarves getting in the way in their kitchen, so instead you need to have the soup brought to a feasting hall for the whole settlement to enjoy. Designate a feasting hall by clicking on {{GUI.ZONES_LABEL}} > {{ROOMS.FEASTING_HALL}}, then add a {{FURNITURE.CAULDRON}} to it. Note that a feasting hall cauldron won’t be placed until a cauldron containing thick, delicious soup is available."
TUTORIAL.7.A,,Over time you will want to expand your food production but this will keep our small settlement nourished for the upcoming winter - your settlers have brought rations to sustain them while the first crops grow.
TUTORIAL.7.B,,"Most items and furniture are produced out of {{MATERIAL_TYPE.WOOD.ADJECTIVE}} {{RESOURCE.PLANKS.PLURAL}} or {{MATERIAL_TYPE.STONE.ADJECTIVE}} {{RESOURCE.STONE.BLOCK.PLURAL}}. It’s important to maintain a large supply of these. {{MATERIAL_TYPE.WOOD.ADJECTIVE}} {{RESOURCE.PLANKS.PLURAL}} are produced in a {{ROOMS.SAWMILL}}, and {{MATERIAL_TYPE.STONE.ADJECTIVE}} {{RESOURCE.STONE.BLOCK.PLURAL}} are crafted by a {{PROFESSION.STONEMASON}} in a {{ROOMS.MASONRY_WORKSHOP}}. Place one of each of these zones, and build a {{FURNITURE.WOODCUTTERS_BENCH}} and {{FURNITURE.STONEMASON_WORKBENCH}} in them."
TUTORIAL.8.A,,"Now you are ready to produce {{MATERIAL_TYPE.WOOD.ADJECTIVE}} {{RESOURCE.PLANKS.PLURAL}} and {{MATERIAL_TYPE.STONE.ADJECTIVE}} {{RESOURCE.STONE.BLOCK.PLURAL}}, but they require other resources to craft them - {{MATERIAL_TYPE.WOOD.ADJECTIVE}} {{RESOURCE.LOGS.PLURAL}} and {{RESOURCE.STONE.UNREFINED.PLURAL}}. Fortunately these can usually be harvested from the game world quite easily."
TUTORIAL.8.B,,Select {{GUI.ORDERS_LABEL}} > {{GUI.ORDERS.CHOP_WOOD}} and click-and-drag over trees to let your woodcutters know to cut them down. Similarly you can select select {{GUI.ORDERS_LABEL}} > {{GUI.ORDERS.MINE}} and click-and-drag an area of the mountain to designate to be mined. Select enough of both to build your stockpiles back up to 40 of each.
TUTORIAL.8.C,,"Be careful with mining! A mined-out area of 7 by 7 tiles without a {{FURNITURE.PILLAR}} built within that area will collapse! "
TUTORIAL.CAMERA.A,,"You can use the W, A, S and D keys or the arrow keys to pan the camera around. Moving the cursor to the edge of the screen also pans the camera, but this can be disabled in the options menu."
TUTORIAL.CAMERA.B,,Scrolling the mouse wheel or pressing the Q and E keys zooms the camera in or out.
TUTORIAL.CAMERA.C,,"In the lower-right section of the screen is the minimap, and you can click on this to jump the camera to that point. Click on the “Minimap” label to show or hide the minimap."
TUTORIAL.CAMERA.D,,Try out these camera controls and then click “Next” to proceed.
TUTORIAL.FINAL.A,,"This covers the basics of playing King under the Mountain. For your next challenge, aim to set up a functioning {{ROOMS.METALWORKS}} with a {{FURNITURE.FORGE}} provided with fuel and refined metal ore. Refined metal ores are produced at the {{FURNITURE.ORE_CRUSHING_STATION}}, and fuel can be crushed from coal or produced out of {{MATERIAL_TYPE.WOOD.ADJECTIVE}} {{RESOURCE.LOGS.PLURAL}} with a {{FURNITURE.CHARCOAL_CLAMP}} in an {{ROOMS.EARTHWORKS}}.
